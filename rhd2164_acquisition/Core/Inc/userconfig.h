// If using HAL drivers, leave this uncommented.
// If using LL drivers, leave this commented.
#define USE_HAL

// If acquiring a short period of data, then exiting and transmitting data
// offline is desired, leave this uncommented.
// If instead transmitting data in real-time is desired, leave this commented.

// Error detect GPIO, by default used to illuminate red LED
// when an error of any kind is detected.
#define ERROR_DETECTED_PORT 		LED_RED_GPIO_Port
#define ERROR_DETECTED_PIN 			LED_RED_Pin
// If this pin goes high (red LED illuminates), check error code
// bits 0-3 to determine which error code has been flagged.
// Default GPIO assignment:
// PE0: ErrorCode_Bit_3 (MSB)
// PG8: ErrorCode_Bit_2
// PG5: ErrorCode_Bit_1
// PG6: ErrorCode_Bit_0 (LSB)
// Once the 4-bit error code has been determined, consult CommErrorStatus in
// rhdinterface.h to determine to which error the code maps.

// How many CONVERT commands are sent in a single sequence,
// which occurs every time the period defined by INTERRUPT_TIM occurs (default 20 kHz).
// Default of 32 indicates that 32 amplifier channels
// are each sampled once per sequence - with double data rate
// for 64-channel chips, that means 32 * 2 = 64 amplifier channels are sampled.
#define CONVERT_COMMANDS_PER_SEQUENCE 32

// How many AUX commands are sent in a single sequence,
// which occurs every time the period defined by INTERRUPT_TIM occurs (default 20 kHz).
// Default of 3 indicates that 3 auxiliary command lists
// each execute a single command per sequence.
#define AUX_COMMANDS_PER_SEQUENCE 3

// How many AUX commands are contained in a single auxiliary
// command list (excluding zcheck_DAC command lists).
// Default of 128 indicates that for each sequence, each of the
// AUX_COMMANDS_PER_SEQUENCE (default 3) command lists executes a single command,
// so that 128 sequences must occur before an auxiliary command
// list finishes and repeats execution from the beginning again.
#define AUX_COMMAND_LIST_LENGTH 128

// IMPORTANT note regarding sample rate:
// The per-channel sample rate is defined by the period of the INTERRUPT_TIM peripheral,
// which generates the interrupt events that trigger SPI sequence transfers.
// The INTERRUPT_TIM peripheral configuration occurs in the .ioc file, and by default
// is set up with the timer's input frequency of 275 MHz (APB1 Timer clock) and a period
// of 13750 cycles, resulting in 20 kHz.

// When recording offline, how many seconds of data should be acquired before
// the acquisition loop is escaped. With the default sample rate of 20000, 1 second of data
// corresponds to 20000 samples per channel.
// Note that on-chip RAM is limited, so setting this number excessively high will cause
// the chip to run out of memory during program execution.
#define NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_TO_ACQUIRE 1.0

// Which of the RHD chip's amplifier channels is selected as the starting point to have its data
// saved and transmitted via USART.
#define FIRST_SAMPLED_CHANNEL 5

// How many channels (starting from FIRST_SAMPLED_CHANNEL) to have their data saved and transmitted via USART.
// Note that for DDR, since each received SPI sample contains 2 channels of data, this number is effectively
// doubled so that with a NUM_CHANNELS_TO_TRANSMIT of 4, 16-bit data of 8 channels is actually being sent via USART.
#define NUM_SAMPLED_CHANNELS 4

// Which peripherals/handles should be used by software, depending on if HAL or LL drivers are used.
// If the user wishes to use a different peripheral, for example SPI2 instead of SPI3, then that
// change should be made here (in addition to configuring that peripheral properly in the .ioc file).
